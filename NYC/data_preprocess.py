    We add fourier terms to deal with the periodical terms like hour of the day, weekdays, months, etc. This function can be used to 
    deal with these terms especially in the linear regression scenarios. For example, if we pass the hours as 0 to 23, the linear
    regression won't know that 0th hour actually next to the 23rd hour. So, putting the hour values as sine and cosine functions
    makes them continuous.
    Args:

        week_k: the number of Fourier terms the weekly period should have. Thus the model will be fit on 2*week_k terms
